      <h2>My games</h2>
      <p id="intro">Throughout my career, I've done many games. I focus mainly on the logic of the code, I love solving bugs, 
        implementing new mechanics, AI. Even though most of these games were made in a team, my work has mainly been that.</p>
  
      <div class="game">
          <p>Wizarding Fight: This game is completely made by me, i made everything from scratch (except the srpites).
            A simple local multiplayer in progress, where you and a friend have to fight each other, best of 10 wins. 
          </p>

      <div class="game">
          <p>Bodhi: My first game made for a Global Game Jam, me and 3 other friends worked here and I focused on the movement, menus, 
            game flow and mechanics. </p>

      </div>
  
      <div class="game">
          <p>Dino Riot: This game was made by me and other 3 friends as well, here I made the AI for the dinosaurs, the gun, the mechanics,
            the logic behind the game, bugs and the game flow.</p>

      <div class="game">

    </div>

    <div class="game">
      <p>Tower Frenzy: Made by me and my 3 best friends, this was our first VR game, this was a class project and we couldn't distribute it but
        we finished. Again, I focused here on AI, game flow, logic, mechanics and the map</p>
